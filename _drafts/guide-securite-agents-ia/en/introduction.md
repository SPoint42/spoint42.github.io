# Security Guide for AI Agent Development

## Introduction

This guide presents best practices for developing secure AI Agents, specifically tailored for our teams working with Python, .NET, and Kotlin/Java. It is based on the identification of the 5 major risks related to AI Agents and proposes concrete solutions for each of them.

## Understanding AI Agents

AI Agents differ from traditional LLMs through their autonomy and ability to act directly on external systems. This power comes with specific security risks that must be addressed from the design phase.

Unlike classic LLMs that simply generate text, AI Agents can:
- Execute actions on external systems
- Use tools (APIs, databases, etc.)
- Make autonomous decisions
- Maintain persistent state and memory
- Interact extensively with users and systems

## Guide Objectives

This guide aims to:
1. Identify risks specific to AI Agents
2. Propose concrete solutions by programming language (Python, .NET, Kotlin/Java)
3. Provide best practices at each phase of the development cycle
4. Establish links with recognized security frameworks like OWASP

## Guide Structure

The guide is organized according to the following sections:

1. **The 5 Major Risks of AI Agents**
   - Understanding each risk and its potential impact
   - Concrete exploitation examples

2. **Solutions and Secure Implementations**
   - Specific implementations for Python, .NET, and Kotlin/Java
   - Patterns and best practices

3. **Integration into the DevSecOps Cycle**
   - Recommendations at each phase of the development cycle
   - Automation tools and methods

4. **References and Resources**
   - Links to OWASP standards
   - Additional documentation and resources
