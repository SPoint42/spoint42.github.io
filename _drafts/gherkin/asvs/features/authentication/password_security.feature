Feature: V2 Authentication Verification Requirements

  @ASVS-V2.1 @L1 @L2 @L3
  Scenario: Verify password security requirements
    When I review the password policy implementation
    Then passwords should be stored with sufficient cryptographic protection
    And passwords should have at least 12 characters minimum length
    And passwords should enforce complexity requirements
    And passwords should be checked against common password lists
